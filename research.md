Why are starlings so successful?

My dissertation focuses on an infamous invader, the European (Common) Starling.

I'm currently working on two major projects:

1: The starling invasion in North America

Starlings arrived in New York City in 1890-1891, and they've grown to 200 million strong in only ten or so generations. I'm working with Scott Werner and others at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to examine the evolutionary drivers of starling success in the North American invasion. This project uses ddRADseq to look at population structure and local adaptation across North America, and as one might expect, North American starlings show incredibly low diversity and differentiation.

2: What do starlings share among invasions?

Around the same time that starlings invaded North America, these pests also arrived in Australia. Given their world-wide success, Lee Ann Rollins (AU), David Clayton (UK), and Scott Werner (US) have led a large team of researchers to build genomic resources for studying Common Starlings in their native range and beyond. I recently joined the team to help analyze the whole genomes that the starling team compiled across all three continents, and it turns out that American and Australian starlings are quite different from one another.
