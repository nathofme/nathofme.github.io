I study the evolution and ecology of birds using comparative and population genetic approaches. In my current work, IÂ use genomic tools to explore why the European starling is such a successful invader world-wide.

I'm also passionate about building community! When I'm not crunching code, you can find me running [dialogues](https://idp.cornell.edu/fellows/), practicing yoga, or perfecting my sourdough.

Connect with me on Twitter at [@nathofme](https://twitter.com/nathofme) or [email me](mailto:nrh44@cornell.edu).
